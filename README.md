Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a functional webpage using Javscript, and access the css and HTML through the DOM. The app is allowing a user to make their own book cover. This application gives the user the tools to create a unique cover of their own and save them all in one place.

### Installation Instructions:

(What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
I believe they just need to go to jheidepriem/romcom and clone the repository. They should be able to open it through their terminal using open index.html. Likewise, they may be able to visit the repository by using this link file:///Users/josephineheidepriem/Turing/Mod1/romcom/index.html

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project was a lot of work. In total I probably spent 20 hours working on it. I am in Mod1. And to be fair, I was able to get help and feedback from mentor, which was crucial to finishing this project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
Write code collaboratively
Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

We used javascript, html, css, github, terminal, and atom.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
This project was really difficult for me to understand going into it. Luckily I had a partner who knew how to start the project and get it going. As I worked through it, and especially the later interations, it really helped me understand more of a full scope of the work. I am probably still very shaky about the terminology used to talk through every aspect, but I would like to practice that more.
